        <li>2 cans tomato paste (6 oz)</li>
        <li>2 cans canned tomato sauce (6.5 ounce)</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper        </li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced/shredded</li>
        <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <l1> <strong>Step 1</strong><p>cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar,  Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></l1>
        <l2><strong>Step 2</strong><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</p></l2>
        <l3><strong>Step 3</strong><p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></l3>
        <l4><strong>Step 4</strong><p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p></l4>    
        <l5><strong>Step 5</strong><p>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p></l5>
